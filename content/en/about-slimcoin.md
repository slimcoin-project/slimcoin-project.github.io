**Slimcoin** is a novel and experimental cryptocurrency created in 2014. It is the first known coin that uses the [Proof of Burn](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn) mechanism to generate blocks. Additionally, it uses Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, making it the first and unique coin with three different block generation mechanisms.

In 2020, we're alive and kicking, and we're **different** from most other "altcoin" communities. We have no hierarchic and centralized structure - so we have no *official development team* that benefits from dubious *pre-mine* or *insta-mine* mechanisms.

All we want is to continue the exciting **Proof of Burn** experiment.  In a few words, Proof of Burn is a mechanism where you get the right to find blocks if you burn coins. *Yes, you destroy your money* - and get a **long-term reward** winning the chance to get block rewards. 

Sounds crazy, huh? It is perhaps easier to understand as a process of **virtual mining**. We have prepared an [simple explanation (ELI5)](/proof-of-burn-eli5/). [And it has very interesting economical properties](https://github.com/slimcoin-project/Slimcoin/wiki/The-magic-of-Proof-of-Burn). It is the only mechanism that allows the users to **regulate the available supply in a decentralized way**.

### Mining, Burning & Minting

Slimcoin is a very open cryptocurrency. There are several methods to earn it if you help with the validation process:

* by **Proof of Work mining**. You can earn Slimcoin even if you don't have any money, just mining it with your computer. Slimcoin's algorithm, DCrypt, is best suited for CPU mining. No ASICs are known for it. Here is the the [Mining Guide](/mining-guide/) for you.

* by **Proof of Stake minting**. Once you got some Slimcoins, you can help with stake minting. This means you can just hold the coins and spend some time with the wallet open. It isn't necessary to mint 24 hours a day to get your reward, as Slimcoin uses the original Peercoin Proof of Stake mechanism. This means that the reward is fixed at 10% of your stake per year: as long as you connect to the network from time to time, it's very likely you find blocks. Here you find a [Proof of Stake minting guide](/proof-of-stake-guide/).

* by **Proof of Burn minting**. A part the methods described above, Slimcoin offers the unique method of Proof of Burn minting. This method is for you if you can afford a long time investment. Burning coins is similar to buying a virtual miner. You need to be aware of the associated risks: The price could go down, and the difficulty can go up considerably if new "burners" enter the game, lowering your profitability. On the other hand, you can get higher rewards over time than when you only stake, above all if you burn a considerable amount. Small burn investments are not recommended if you don't know what you're doing, as in this case the probability to find blocks can be low. Here you find our [Proof of Burn minting guide](/proof-of-burn-guide/).

### Inscription service & Decentralized Websites

Since version 0.5, Slimcoin has a built-in blockchain website publishing service which lets you **publish websites or blogs** in a decentralized way *without hosting nor domains*. Simply publish your content as a torrent and let the Slimcoin blockchain be your version manager!

All you have to do is to use the *inscription service* provided by the Slimcoin client.

The publishing feature uses the awesome [Web2Web](https://github.com/elendirx/web2web) and [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) technologies. Your readers only need a modern browser - no additional software! So your voice will be heard also outside the nerd-space.

*Stay tuned!* This feature is still new and in alpha, and the Web2Web page generator has still to be ported. But you already can experiment with it.

### Slimcoin Exchanges

You can trade, buy and sell Slimcoin at the following exchange:

* [Freiexchange BTC/SLM](https://freiexchange.com/market/SLM/BTC)

### Download Slimcoin & Source Code

You can download Windows, Linux and Mac OS binaries [in our "Releases" section](https://github.com/slimcoin-project/Slimcoin/releases). The current beta release is 0.6. It is fully functional, but may still contain bugs.

The source code is [here on Github](https://github.com/slimcoin-project/Slimcoin). Chose the "master" branch if you want to test our new features.
