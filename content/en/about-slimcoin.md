[//]: # (Slimcoin is a novel and experimental cryptocurrency created in 2014.)

**Slimcoin** is a novel, energy-efficient cryptocurrency fairly launched in 2014.  It's the first known coin that uses the [Proof of Burn](/proof-of-burn-eli5/) mechanism to generate blocks. Additionally, it uses Proof of Work and Proof of Stake, making it the first and unique coin with three different block generation mechanisms.

**Slimcoin** doen't have any hierarchic or centralized structure - so there is no *official development team* - anybody is welcome to contribute as much as he can and wish.

[//]: # (All we want is to continue the exciting **Proof of Burn** experiment.  In a few words, Proof of Burn is a mechanism where you get the right to find blocks if you burn coins. *Yes, you destroy your money* - and get a **long-term reward** winning the chance to get block rewards.)

[//]: # (Sounds crazy, huh? It is perhaps easier to understand as a process of **virtual mining**. We have prepared an [simple explanation ELI5]/proof-of-burn-eli5/. [And it has very interesting economical properties] https://github.com/slimcoin-project/Slimcoin/wiki/The-magic-of-Proof-of-Burn. It is the only mechanism that allows the users to **regulate the available supply in a decentralized way**.)

[//]: # (### Inscription service & Decentralized Websites)

[//]: # (Since version 0.5, Slimcoin has a built-in blockchain website publishing service which lets you **publish websites or blogs** in a decentralized way *without hosting nor domains*. Simply publish your content as a torrent and let the Slimcoin blockchain be your version manager!)

[//]: # (All you have to do is to use the *inscription service* provided by the Slimcoin client.)

[//]: # (The publishing feature uses the awesome [Web2Web] https://github.com/elendirx/web2web)

[//]: # (and [WebTorrent] https://webtorrent.io/)

[//]: # (technologies. Your readers only need a modern browser - no additional software! So your voice will be heard also outside the nerd-space.)

[//]: # (*Stay tuned!* This feature is still new and in alpha, and the Web2Web page generator has still to be ported. But you already can experiment with it.)

### Earning Slimcoins: Mining, Minting & Burning  

Slimcoin is a relativelly easy to get cryptocurrency. There are several methods to earn it by helping with the validation process:

* by **Proof of Work mining**. You can earn Slimcoin even if you don't want to spend your money to buy it - just mine it with your computer. Slimcoin's algorithm, DCrypt, is best suited for CPU mining. No ASICs are known for it. Here is the [Mining Guide](/mining-guide/) for you.

* by **Proof of Stake minting**. Once you've got some Slimcoins, you can help with stake minting. Which means that you just need to hold some Slimcoin and spend some time keeping your wallet open. It isn't necessary to mint 24 hours a day to get your reward, as Slimcoin uses the original Peercoin Proof of Stake mechanism - the rewards are fixed at 10% of your stake per year: as long as you connect to the network from time to time, it's very likely you'll find the blocks. Here is our [Proof of Stake minting guide](/proof-of-stake-guide/).

* by **Proof of Burn minting**. A part the methods described above, Slimcoin offers the unique method of Proof of Burn minting. This method is for those who who have large financial resources and can afford a long term "investment". Burning coins is similar to buying a virtual mining farm. You have to be aware of the associated risks: the price of SLM could go down or the difficulty can go up considerably lowering your profitability, if new "burners" enter the game. On the other hand, you can get higher rewards over time than just by PoS minting, above all if you have a considerable amount of SLMs to burn. Small burn "investments" are not recommended, especially if you don't know what you're doing, as in this case the probability to find blocks can be low. Here is our [Proof of Burn minting guide](/proof-of-burn-guide/).
