    The mission of the cryptocurrency.
     </h2>
    <h5 class="ui header center aligned">
The introduction of the blockchain appeared since the beginning as a revolutionary step for mankind. <br><br>
The principles of trustlessness, decentralization, immutability of transactions and of the initial money emission conditions, the exclusion of the middlemen and relative costs are all breathtaking concepts indeed especially because they have been practically realized in the delivered code that everybody can verify by himself.<br><br>
Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies that were trying to develop and improve the initial idea have become very popular over time. Many people all around the world are already making part ot the movement both as developers and as traders/hodlers.<br><br>
However more than one decade after the initial launch it seems to be clear that no incisive real world use of the cryptocurrencies has been realized so far.<br><br>
Thus the uncovered speculative potential of the cryptocurrencies has become the main focus for the majority of its users.<br><br>
We believe that the cryptocurrency has yet the undiscovered or at least not clearly formulated mission - to improve the people's lives by financing the technological and humanitarian projects that can't be funded by traditional means.

    Slimcoin in context of cryptocurrency mission.
     </h2>
    <h5 class="ui header center aligned">
Since some year we are working on the token that will be launched, together with the specifically designed Dex, on Slimcoin's blockchain using peerassets technology.<br><br>

The technology behind the token is our original idea.<br><br>

The token will be issued in a completely decentralized and fair way and will be initially used as financial support for Slimcoin's development.<br><br>

However we are seeing many other practical opportunities for our token in context of our cryptocurrencies' mission vision.<br><br>

In fact our token was originally a result of many years of research in the third sector area and was meant as a solution to the most complex challenges on that field.<br><br>

Thus the projects as OpenCharity, OpenTechnology, OpenDesign, OpenInfrastructure and many others may arise using our token as soon as Slimcoin's development is aligned once again with the current industry standards.<br><br>

To keep in touch with us and to be updated about the most recent developments of our project or to participate in the token's and Dex's tests please consider subscribing to our <a href="https://discord.gg/ffeDjmV">Discord channel<a>.
